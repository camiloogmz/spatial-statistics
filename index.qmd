Welcome!

On this website, you will find the projects I developed for the *Spatial Statistics* course at the National University of Colombia. These projects mainly focus on the geostatistical analysis of weather conditions in Texas (USA) using several approaches, as well as the analysis of areal data from Nepal. All analyses were conducted using `R`.
